Hypothesis Testing Calculator test output 05-01-2016 15:40

Each test consists of: (e.g. 'Coin toss')
A success is getting: (e.g. 'Heads')
Number of tests: 19

p is the probability that (e.g. 'a coin toss') from the population gives (e.g. 'heads').
X is the number of (e.g. 'heads') in a sample size of 19

H₀: p = 0.3
H₁: p < 0.3

Significance level = 0.02.

Assume H₀ is true:
X ~ B(19, 0.3)
X is distributed binomially with n = 19, p = 0.3.

Number of successes, r = 10

P(X ≥ 10) > 0.02%

Accept H0 (comment on the null)

There is not enough evidence to suggest that the number of successful trials in the population is greater than expected (~6.00 (to 2dp)).
